                  Megan is a sweet and giving girl who always sees the beauty in people. As exciting as it was to be raised in Novi, MI. She made it her mission to live and explore as many beautiful cities as she could. Thanks to her beloved sister Wendy it was possible to jump from the neon nights of Miami, through the diverse city of London, to then learn the leisurely ways of Italy. While Jocelyn was exploring and realizing her passion in life, she realized she needed to find her way back to the city she knew her dream job was waiting for her in fashion.

                  Mike is a burly and impatient Eastern European. He moved from his homeland Bulgaria to the lovely city of Toronto at the young and tender age of 22. Kal then found himself in the IT mecca of Seattle and realized after 9 years of the beautiful mountain backdrop and serene lakes that he needs to escape to the center of the universe, New York.

          <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
          <p>
          It all started when Mike had a brainstorm and asked Megan if she would be willing to run the Chicago Marathon with him in the upcoming fall of 2017.  He then had another brainstorm and thought it was good idea to go hiking in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada immediately after running 26.2 miles.  Somehow Mike was able to convince Megan that this was a good idea and his plan was in motion.
          </p>
          <p>
          After completing the Chicago Marathon which was one of the hardest journeys of their lives they immediately took off on a flight to Canada that would change their lives forever.On the very last day of their vacation, Megan and Mike went on a 5 mile hike on the Johnston Canyon and the hike ended with canyon opening up to a huge meadow surrounded by pools of water that change colors throughout the day.  After making sure they were the only two people in the canyon valley, Mike nervously set up his iPhone to properly capture the moment.  As Megan strangley watched Mike, he got down on one knee and asked Megan to spend the rest of her life with him!

      <h2>GETTING TO NEW BUFFALO, MI</h2>
      <p>Being a popular summer tourist destination, getting to Croatia is relatively easy. The closest major city to Hvar is&nbsp;
         <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/a8JeWAEuugN2'>Split</a> and it is fairly well connected by pretty much all European airlines
         and some low-cost carriers, such as&nbsp;
         <a href='https://wizzair.com/#/booking/select-flight/LTN/SPU/2017-08-22/2017-09-02/1/0/0'>WizzAir</a> and&nbsp;
         <a href='https://www.eurowings.com/en.html'>Eurowings</a>
      </p>
      <p>The second closest major airport is in <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/goc5oZWa3wC2'>Dubrovnik</a>. It is about 5 hours away
         from Hvar via a ferry, which is kind of far, but if you are planning on doing some touring before or after the wedding it is
         a great location to visit. Have a look at the 'Things to do section' further down for more information on that.
      </p>
      <p>As of the time of writing there are no&nbsp;
         <a href='https://www.kayak.com/flights/NYC-SPU/2017-08-25/2017-09-02/2adults'>direct flights</a>&nbsp;
         from the US or Canada to Croatia, so guests coming from there will have to do at least one connection in a major European hub
         such as Frankfurt, Zurich or Amsterdam.

      <h2>HARBOR COUNTRY in MICHIGAN</h2>
      <p>Harbor Country is close by, yet a world away. It is a trademarked destination for an eclectic collection of 8 towns: Michiana, Grand Beach, New Buffalo, Three Oaks, Union Pier, Lakeside, Harbert, and Sawyer <a href='https://www.harborcountry.org/'>website.</a> Harbor Country combines the best of both worlds ‚Äî endless days at the beach and countrysides brimming with farms and orchards. Add a vibrant arts and culture community, a lively local food scene, and an explosion of world-class wineries, craft breweries and distilleries, it‚Äôs no wonder that Harbor Country has also become a year-round home for ex-urbanites in search of a slower pace of life amid the natural beauty of the Lake Michigan shore.

      <div id='gmap'></div>

      <p>The bus or taxi will drop you off at the Split bus station, which is on the water. The bus drop-off is only 5 minutes walk
         from the ferry ticket kiosk. There you can buy tickets or ask for the terminal from which your ferry leaves if it is unclear
         from the large electronic panel infront of it, listing the departures. The ferry ticket kiosk looks like this:

      </p>

      <p>Once you are at the seaport and looking for transportation to the island, please note that there are two landing spots on the
         island - Hvar Town and the Old Town (Stari Grad). The wedding will be in Hvar Town, which is in the south-west end of the island,
         not in the Old Town, which is on the nortern end. Please make sure you are boarding the right ferry, but even if you make a
         mistake, stay calm because there is a very convenient bus between the two. As a rule, the car ferries go to Old Town (Stari Grad)
         and take about 2 hours to travel and the fast passenger ferries (catamaran) go directly to Hvar Town and take 1 hour.
      </p>

      <div id='gmap'></div>

      <p>There are two ferry companies which serve the route from Split to Hvar - Jadrolinija and Kapetan Luka. Below we have information
         for each of them.
      </p>

      <h3><a href='http://www.jadrolinija.hr/en/ferry-croatia'>Jadrolinija</a></h3>
      <p>This is a high-speed catamaran service from Split to Hvar Town which takes about 65 min. This is the fastest option and costs
         around 10 EUR/11 USD per person. If you have a car, this site also contains the schedule and pricing for the ferries, which
         transport cars to the island.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3><a href='http://www.krilo.hr/en/index.html'>Kapetan Luka</a></h3>
      <p>This is the regular ferry service which takes about 2.5 hours and should cost around 5-10 EUR/6-11 USD per person.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3><a href='https://www.atlantis-marine.net/en/croatia-boat-transfers'>Chartered Speed Boat</a></h3>
      <p>If you are coming as a group or feel like a one percenter, this site has information for inclusive transportation packages with
         pickup from the airport. The sailing part of the journey takes between 45 min to 1 hour, which is similar to the catamaran service,
         but is a little bit more convenient because it also includes a pickup from the airport. If you choose this option, there is a 5%
         discount using <SecretTooltip fnTooltip={() => { return 'adriaticweddings'; }}>this code</SecretTooltip> (please click on the
         'this' in order to show it).
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>DRIVING</h2>
      <p>For those renting a car or driving to Croatia, we found the driving conditions on the island to be good and there is a
         parking spot right in the center of the town for 1 EUR/hour or 12 EUR/day.
      </p>
      <p>
         Please note that unless you are coming by car to the island of Hvar, there should not be a need for you to rent one. There are
         many organized boat trips to discover the surrounding Dalmatian islands and cabrio cars can be rented daily at a fairly decent
         price from Hvar itself and the paperwork is not that much. For example we rented this funny car for about 60 USD for a day trip:

      <h2>ACCOMMODATIONS</h2>
      <p>Once on the island in Hvar Town there are various accommodation options ranging from fancy hotels to renting an apartment
         on <a href='https://goo.gl/uHTDYn'>AirBnB</a>. The wedding will be in the Amfora Resort so any accommodation within walking
         distance from there should be fine.
      </p>
      <p>From our research we have found that hotels are fairly expensive and there are very nice AirBnB options available, so we highly
         recommend doing that.
      </p>
      <p>For guests wishing to stay in a hotel, the <a href='http://www.suncanihvar.com/'>Suncani Hvar</a> chain of hotels offers a 20%
         discount using <SecretTooltip fnTooltip={() => { return 'WEDDKALOIANJOCELYN'; }}>this code</SecretTooltip> (please click on the
         'this' in order to show it). The code must be entered in the <i>'Corporate/Promo Code ?'</i> section for the discounted prices to
         apply and is valid for staying 5 days prior and 5 days after the wedding day. While this code indeed reduces the listed prices,
         we have found that booking through <a href='https://goo.gl/2xzaIg'>Expedia</a> or <a href='https://goo.gl/z6zsZk'>Hotels.com</a>&nbsp;
         shows about the same prices or in some cases even cheaper, so please bear that in mind as well.

      <p>Located in the very south of the country, Dubrovnik was once called the 'Pearl of the Adriatic' for its architecture and importance
         in trade. We won't pretend that we know much about its history, but it is a place which must be visited and is also a convenient
         location to fly into and work your way up the coast to Hvar. On top of that, for the 'Game of Thrones' fans, quite a few scenes from
         this show were filmed in Dubrovnik. See&nbsp;
